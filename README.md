# GoBabbyApp
This is a database application helps to manage the Midwifery services (in a simplified real-world context). I decomposed the project into three parts: 1.design a model;  2.create a schema and implement a database using DB2, insert/maintain/update data;  3.develop application programs and implement User Interface

In this repo, there are:

- an Entity-Relationship Model, which is an pictorially description of the data, illustrating the relationship between different entities, including Key/Participation Constraints, ISA hierarchies, Weak Entities, ternary relationship etc.




- a java file (GoBabbyApp.java): the java code of this application
