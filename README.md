# GoBabbyApp
This is a database application helps to manage the Midwifery services (in a simplified real-world context). 


The project consists of three phases: 
1. design a model;  
2. create a schema and implement a database using DB2, insert/maintain/update data;  
3. develop application programs and implement User Interface


In this repo, there are:
  ------
 
- proj_Intro.pdf: a detailed description / requirements of this project, including what I thought, what I did and what I learnt.

  ------
  (Phase 1 - design)
  
- ER_model.pdf: an Entity-Relationship Model, which is an pictorially description of the data, illustrating the relationship between different entities, including Key/Participation Constraints, ISA hierarchies, Weak Entities, ternary relationship etc.

- Assum_Restr.pdf: several points of Assumptions and Restrictions that I made/found during the process, as well as a Relational Translation of the ER model.

- createtbl.log / loaddata.log / droptbl.log: showing successful execution of corresponding .sql files.
