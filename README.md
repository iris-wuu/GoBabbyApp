# GoBabbyApp
This is a database application helps to manage the Midwifery services (in a simplified real-world context). I decomposed the project into three parts: 
1.design a model;  
2.create a schema and implement a database using DB2, insert/maintain/update data;  
3.develop application programs and implement User Interface


In this repo, there are:

- Project_Requirements.pdf: a detailed description of this project, including what I thought, what I did and what I learnt.

- ER_model.jpeg: an Entity-Relationship Model, which is an pictorially description of the data, illustrating the relationship between different entities, including Key/Participation Constraints, ISA hierarchies, Weak Entities, ternary relationship etc.

- Assum_Restr.pdf: several points of Assumptions and Restrictions that I made/found during the process

- GoBabbyApp.java: java code of this application
